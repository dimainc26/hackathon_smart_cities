# Smart Cities 
## Hackathon 2019

We partaked at a competition on SMART CITIES. The topic was dealing with the improvement of the mobility in town. The competion was tough due to the number of competitors and the brillant ideas exposed. But like they say the first price is for the best team..
Thanks GOD, we ended up first on this competition... The laureates of 2019
